# TRISTAN's TETRIS
Hi, you are looking at an attempt to build a TETRIS using NextJS and its friends ReactJS, TypeScript, TailWind just as a sand box.

I'm trying stuff on purpose: using React with classes or functions, using async methods, using SSR... don't look for a purpose on every choice.

Sounds are pixabay's.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or your favorite equivalent
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
